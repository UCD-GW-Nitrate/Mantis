# Mantis
This is a playground for the development of the forward implementation 
phase of the NPSAT. At the moment there are two implementations.

1. Matlab 
2. Python

## Matlab implementation
Matlab requires just one line code that loads the GUI
```
Mantis
```
The first step is to load the data.
To keep the size of this repo small I'm not uploading to github the 
required data but the 
[links where to download the data](https://github.com/giorgk/Mantis/blob/master/Local/Readme.md).

The second step is to adjust the loading reduction for each crop using
the sliders.

The last step is to press run and wait...

### Dependencies
This code depends on some functions of the 
[mSim toolbox](http://subsurface.gr/software/msim/). Simply 
[download](http://subsurface.gr/software/msim/msim-download/) and follow
few simple steps to install it. 
The `msim_compile` command is quite important as it improves the performance almost 8 times, but the code works even without.


## Python implementation
Not alot to say here as this is in primitive stage.
For the time being one need to 
[download](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1OH0R6OH5piws8l9tvqBvuX3fu_K-IawE) 
the _URFdata.mat_ and _data4python.mat_ files and add them inside the *Local* 
folder.
